## Overview

The Mass Spring Damper system is a classical mechanical system that consists of a mass attached to a wall by means of a spring and a damper. This system is widely used to demonstrate the principles of dynamics and control systems.

In this demo, the differential equation governing the motion of the mass is numerically solved using MATLAB's ODE solvers. The simulation allows for varying the mass, spring constant, and damping coefficient to observe their effects on the system's behavior.

## Features

- Interactive script to simulate the Mass Spring Damper system's response to initial conditions.
- Visualization of the mass position versus time.
- Ability to change parameters (mass, spring constant, damping coefficient) and initial conditions (initial position and velocity).
- Analysis of underdamped, overdamped, and critically damped cases.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this demo, you need:
- MATLAB (R2018b or later recommended)
- Basic understanding of control systems and MATLAB scripting

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Extract the files to your desired directory.
3. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory where you extracted the files.

### Usage

To run the demo, execute the main script in the MATLAB command window:

```matlab
run('mass_spring_damper_demo.m')
```

Follow the prompts in the command window to input the system parameters and initial conditions. The simulation will run, and plots will be generated to show the system's response.
